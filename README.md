Why I choose Advent of Code:

- Python programming exercises: data manipulation, algorithm design, time optimization
- Problem solving exercises
- Great community resources on reddit
- A mix of easy, medium, and really difficult problems (you never know which one until you do it)
- Helps me develop a coding mindset so I can solve LeetCode/HackerRank/real-world challenges more effectively

I also have takeaway notes after solving the problems and try to frequently review them:
